If the tool destroyed the **supporting block** (floor) before the **attached block** (Elevator Plate):\r\n1. The support block breaks.\r\n2. Minecraft physics detects the attached block is floating and breaks it, dropping an item (Drop 1).\r\n3. The Explosive Tool continues its iteration and tries to break the attached block again, dropping the item a second time (Drop 2).\r\n\r\nThis resulted in infinite duplication of Elevator Plates and similar items.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nModified `ExplosiveTool.java` to implement a sorting mechanism for the destruction list.\r\n\r\n1.  **Y-Level Sorting:** The list of blocks to be destroyed (`blocksToDestroy`) is now sorted by Y-level in **descending order** (Top to Bottom).\r\n    * Logic: `blocksToDestroy.sort((b1, b2) -> Integer.compare(b2.getY(), b1.getY()));`\r\n    * This ensures that attached blocks (Top) are broken by the tool *before* their support blocks (Bottom) are removed.\r\n\r\n2.  **Safety Check:** Added a validation check `if (block.getType() != Material.AIR)` before breaking to ensure the tool does not attempt to break a block that has already been removed by other means/plugins.\r\n\r\nThis change completely resolves the duplication glitch while maintaining the intended behavior of the Explosive Tool.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\nResolves #4037\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [x] I have made sure that the proposed changes do not break compatibility across the supported Minecraft versions (1.16.* - 1.20.*).\r\n- [x] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [ ] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [x] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4344","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4344/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4344/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4344/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4344","id":3737387945,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe865Snyj","number":4344,"title":"fix Bug #4333","user":{"login":"eygwi","id":245492840,"node_id":"U_kgDODqHsaA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245492840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi","html_url":"https://github.com/eygwi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygwi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2025-12-17T05:22:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-17T05:22:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4344","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4344","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4344.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4344.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where the **Auto Drier** machine would continue to register recipes and allow crafting for items that have been explicitly disabled in `Items.yml`.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `registerDefaultRecipes` method blindly registered all hardcoded recipes without checking the `isDisabled()` state of the output item.

When dealing with corrupt or malicious tile entities, this could potentially lead to server crashes or unintended behavior.\r\n\r\nThe fix implements a comprehensive try-catch structure to properly handle exceptions and provide informative logs. Additionally, it implements a fallback mechanism using Bukkit's native block setting functionality when the primary method fails.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nhttps://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit/commit/abaa347ad4856b209c741a8b29884d14a54c4b3d\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35925","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4315","id":3038067987,"node_id":"I_kwDOATMVe861FT0T","number":4315,"title":"Exploxive

not.\r\n\r\nAlso, since `sfitem.hasItemMeta()` has been judged\r\nWhy should the variable of this ItemMeta be named `possibleSfItemMeta`, and the same goes for `possibleItemId`\r\n\r\nIn a word,maybe change like:\r\n```java\r\n                 if (id != null && id.equals(possibleItemId)) { \r\n                     Debug.log(TestCase.CARGO_INPUT_TESTING, \"  Item IDs matched!\"); \r\n  \r\n

Description\r\nFixed not dropping sensitive blocks once and for all\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR takes a different approach from all other solutions. It listens for `BlockPhysicsEvent` which fires before block update. Inside listener it checks if block can be placed in the location where event was fired. This is the best method to listen for collapsing sensitive blocks without a headache with `SENSITIVE_MATERIALS` tag.\r\n\r\nThe only downside of this solution is that it require at least version 1.18 because it uses `BlockData#isSupported` method.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n- #3182\r\n- #3831\r\n- #3009\r\n- #4069\r\n- #4037\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

This behavior also occurs when a block update is triggered. This bug was observed on a server running Minecraft Paper version 1.20.2 and the latest version of Slimefun.\r\nI demonstrated it here with Galactifun, but it happens with all addons that use blocks with physics.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1.

And, the bug has existed for more than 5 months.\r\n\r\nIf a recipe needs [64,32] (total 64+32 = 96 items), the machine(s) can't find the recipe, but I place the items like [32,64], it works.\r\nHowever, it still can find the recipe, but if you place items like [64,64], machine(s) can't find the recipe again.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1.The recipe needs items that amount >64 (but not a multiple of 64)\r\n2.place similar items like [64,64] in machines' input slots\r\n3.Machines doesn't take items\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nThe machines will take 96 items and there's only 32 items in the input slots\n\n### 📷 Screenshots /

1.20.*).\r\n- [ ] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [ ] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [ ] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What changed\r\n* There's a new config property - `storage.player-data`\r\n  * This accepts two values, `legacy` and `binary`\r\n  * `binary` is marked as experimental\r\n  * `legacy` is the default value for now\r\n* If `binary` (this PR) is selected in the config for player data we will show a large warning banner in the console:\r\n![experimental warning](https://i.walshy.dev/fLzZbBNbIgb2VenGW5.png)\r\n* Created a new BinaryStorage to handle writing the files as binary (more on this later)\r\n* This BinaryStorage is changing the way researches are saved, they're now using their NamespacedKey's rather than incremental IDs. This has been a change we should have made forever ago and this is step 1 to removing these number IDs.\r\n\r\n## Storage choice\r\n\r\nOk so, as you can see from the PR, the storage is done with NBT. The question I'm sure you're asking is why NBT over xyz?\r\nWell, there's a few reasons;\r\n1. Familiarity\r\n  a. Lots of server owners and developers are familiar with NBT. This makes adoption internally and externally _much_ easier (especially with how much MC has leaned into it over the years)\r\n3. Solid storage\r\n  a. NBT is about as small as it can get. Some people think it's inflated, the format isn't. Usage however is. That isn't something any format can really prevent.\r\n4. Existing tooling\r\n  a. Lots of existing tooling exists for server owners to read these files (a bit more on this later as well)\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This is a simple implementation which would have to have the whole file rewritten each time. I'll explore ways to avoid this but without limiting file size, there isn't a great way to do it.\r\n\r\n### Usage example\r\n\r\n(backpack contains 3 Slimefun items; Energized Energy Capacitor, Energized Solar Generator and a Multi Tool VII)\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 walshy  staff  3511 11 Feb 23:41 52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 3.5 KB\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches and a waypoint\r\n\r\nplayer file;\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  3511 12 Feb 00:42 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n3.5 KB\r\n\r\nwaypoint file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  110 12 Feb 00:42 data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n110 bytes\r\n\r\n**Total**: 3.6 KB\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches, a backpack and a waypoint\r\n\r\nplayer file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  8526 12 Feb 00:00 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n8.5 KB\r\n\r\nwaypoint player file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  110 12 Feb 00:00 data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n110 bytes\r\n\r\n**Total**: 8.6 KB\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches (no compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  6875 12 Feb 00:08 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 6.8 KB\r\n\r\n(this is so big because of using namespaces instead of int IDs, these take up way more space per research)\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches (gzip compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  2308 12 Feb 00:06 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 2.3 KB\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches and a waypoint (gzip compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  2457 12 Feb 00:37 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 2.4 KB\r\n\r\n**1,164 bytes** smaller than legacy, **32.1%** reduction in size\r\n(reminder that most of this space will be taken by the namespace researches -- with int IDs this would be much smaller)\r\n\r\n## Tooling\r\n\r\nI'm sure we've all used NBT programs in the past to view an NBT file, [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer) is the biggest one, there's also [NBT Studio](https://github.com/tryashtar/nbt-studio). The goal is for these programs (and others) to be able to view the files. I haven't tested this yet but I think this would be ideal.\r\n\r\nHowever, these only support the compression algorithms that MC support (gzip & zlib). I'd love to use lz4 or zstd. Luckily, MC recently announced lz4 in [snapshot 24w04a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w04a) which will be coming in 1.20.5. This hopefully means one or both of these tools update to support it.\r\nThat still doesn't mean they'd support zstd though so maybe we go lz4?\r\n\r\nSo as we stand today, we can't really go better than gzip/zlib but hopefully soon we can do lz4. Is this ok? How much should we care about existing tooling?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to avoid building our own 😅 \r\n\r\n## For the reviewers\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n\r\n* Are we good with NBT? Any other format people _really_ want?\r\n  * If another format, why? What advantage does it give?\r\n* Do we want to save player data elsewhere?\r\n  * We've been saving to `data-storage/Slimefun/Players` and `data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints` for a long time. If we want to change that, this is the time\r\n  * One change at least I'd like to make is moving waypoints into the player files. I need to figure out exactly how the shared waypoints work though before I do this, they seem to not do anything different but then confused how they're shared.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> As we stand today (12th Feb), looking for a \"yay\" or \"nay\" on the PR approach and answers to the above questions rather than a \"this code and data structure is perfect\".\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- TODO\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Sign off from reviewers we want to go this way\r\n- [ ] Finish up NBT side on dough\r\n  - [ ] Write any more methods that'd be helpful\r\n  - [ ] Document all functions (snooze)\r\n  - [ ] Add more tests covering more complex cases + compression\r\n- [ ] Implement backpack support\r\n- [ ] Cleanup a bit\r\n- [ ] Do some thorough testing\r\n\r\n### After this PR\r\n\r\n* Work on getting to a more stable/finalized API for storage as a whole\r\n* Build migration from legacy -> binary\r\n* Work on moving binary storage to default\r\n\r\n## Census\r\n\r\n**Yay** - 3\r\n@J3fftw1 \r\n@ProfElements \r\n@Sfiguz7 \r\n\r\n**Nay** - 0","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4126/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114","id":2113622102,"node_id":"I_kwDOATMVe859-1BW","number":4114,"title":"Hazmat suits do not provide radiation protection in 1.17.1","user":{"login":"Boomer-1","id":75179680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTc5Njgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75179680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1","html_url":"https://github.com/Boomer-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2024-02-01T22:28:51Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T02:36:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"### ❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nAs reported by Gers in the Slimefun Discord here\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/565557184348422174/565569196218384385/1201521452143353918\r\nhazmat suits are not working in 1.17.1.

The first was block storage.\r\nThe second that came up was that because worlds have thousands more machines than they used to years ago, that there's too many slimefun items to get all the data saved before the server shuts down.\r\n\r\nIt's been discussed that it seems to happen a lot more often with items placed within the 10 minutes before a server restart. Unfortunately no one has been able to consistently confirm this. \r\n\r\nNetworks and IE have been the subject of this discussion quite frequently, but its because they are 2 of the most commonly used addons, however it's been brought up in the discord with core and multiple addons having this happen.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nno items should leave sf data behind after breaking  to cause this. when sf machines are mined, it should be as if nothing was ever there.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\nno error reports get generated.\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nbeen happening for some time. \n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107","id":2092003244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85kn4uW","number":4107,"title":"Make the CropGrowthAccelerator take speed into account (grow multiple…","user":{"login":"pustinek","id":21089157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDg5MTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21089157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek","html_url":"https://github.com/pustinek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"✨ Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-01-20T10:34:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-25T18:23:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4107","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"… blocks at once)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nThis fixes the crop growth accelerator and makes it work as is advertised. \r\nBefore it's only accelerating the growth of one block at at time instead of based on the Speed parameter of the accelerator.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nJust take into account the speed of the accelerator block\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Have two signed books (A and B).\r\n2. Place these blocks (listed from left to right, but placement order does not matter, appaerently):\r\n   - Chest,\r\n   - Cargo Node (Input),\r\n   - Cargo Manager\r\n   - Cargo Node (Output),\r\n   - Chest.\r\n 3. Set the Cargo Node (Input) type to Blacklist.\r\n 4. Insert the book to be copied (A) into the right (output) chest.\r\n 5. Insert the other book (B) into the left (input) chest.\r\n 6. In the right chest you will have the copied book (A) two times.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to player heads.\r\n\r\nAlso it works for higher quantities of items: for example, if you were to fill the right chest with the A books, and then proceed to insert some B books into the left chest, the item stacks in the right chest will all get eventually filled up.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you would only have 1 A book in the right chest and you were to put 17 B books into the left chest, you would end up with 16 A books and 2 B books in the right chest. So the issue is clearly **linked to incomplete item stacks**.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the B book to transfer to the right (output) chest, instead of getting another A book.\r\n\r\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\nSee the bug reproduction process screencap: https://ctrlv.tv/ZLMh\r\n\r\n### 📜 Server Log\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### 💻 Server Software\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\r\n\r\n1.17.x\r\n\r\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n```\r\nThis Server uses the following setup of Slimefun:\r\nPaper git-Paper-411 (MC: 1.17.1)\r\nSlimefun RC -

This applies to all the types [listed on the wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recipe#crafting_special_*). This renders automating the crafting of items like firework rockets or dyed shulker boxes impossible.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a server running just Slimefun on Paper.\r\n2. Obtain an Vanilla Auto Crafter.\r\n3. Crouch + Right Click with one of the items listed under the special crafting category.\r\n4. The Vanilla Auto Crafter will say no recipe for the item can be found.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nThe Vanilla Auto Crafter will attempt to find a recipe within reason for a given item. This would be a recipe of gunpowder and paper for a flight duration 1 explosion-less firework rocket.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n[Larger than 10mb, put on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pRBggUAJY)\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/PpvkMTfh\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\n![image](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/98472539/0d9803f5-ef45-4b36-8c54-45e2887f3446)\r\n\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","id":1981405244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85ezymk","number":4018,"title":"Add Horizontal Offset support to Holograms","user":{"login":"test137E29B","id":37277599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc3NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37277599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B","html_url":"https://github.com/test137E29B","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683831333,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODMxMzMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%88%20Feature","name":"🎈 Feature","color":"C8E3F2","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request adds a new feature."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-11-07T13:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T15:41:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4018","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nHologram projectors are really nice things to use, but they lack horizontal offset support meaning any design without a central block annoyingly has an offset hologram.

❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nWhen a member logged on and messed with the Slimefun components, one output chest was working while the other was not and when he tried to use an energy regulator it did not show him as owner rather it shown CS-CoreLib as owner and when he tried to destroy it and place it back it just shown it as CS-CoreLib's head rather than an actual component including the \"Connecting...\" hologram as well as the Simple Elevator when trying to be used it doesn't work and when destroyed and put into inventory it says Block of Quartz. After these problems rose, I saw in the console a message that states \"[20:15:08 ERROR]: [Slimefun] An Exception was caught while ticking the Block Tickers Task for Slimefun vDEV - 1068 (git cab97b1a)\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: World \"Teknocraft S3.5\" seems to have been deleted.

Description\n\nEnabling `call-explosive-event` on explosive tools caused only the targeted Slimefun blocks to be dropped and drop nothing on the exploded part.

Enable `call-explosive-event` on explosive pickaxe\r\n2. Try to break Slimefun blocks\r\n3.

#3585 for context.\r\n\r\nIn MC 1.19 Spigot has removed `commons-lang` from its dependencies.\r\nWe really shouldn't be shading this library just for this one feature and instead switch to what Spigot uses.\r\n\r\nSo any `Validate.notNull(x, msg)` will become `Preconditions.checkNotNull(x, msg)` and any `Validate.isTrue(x, msg)` shall become `Preconditions.checkArgument(x, msg)`.\r\nIt would be really helpful if somebody could make a pull request for this and remove `commons-lang` from our
